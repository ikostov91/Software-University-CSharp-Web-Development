                                <h2>Force India likely to change name to Force One</h2>
                            </header>

                            <p>
                                The team's original plan had been to use Force One to create a more generic identity, in an attempt to appeal to sponsors. Earlier this year, several UK companies were set up using that name as the first step towards a change.
                                However, feedback from the sport's new owners has suggested that the name is potentially too close to that of F1, especially when abbreviated.
                                Deputy team principal Bob Fernley insists that while the team has not been told definitively that Force One won't be approved, it is now considering less controversial alternatives.
                                "We're going to have difficulty getting it through as Force One," deputy team principal Bob Fernley told Motorsport.com.

                                    <h2>Lauda "worried" about F1 future under Liberty</h2>

                                <p>
                                    Amid the background of tensions between teams and Liberty over future engine rules and a drop in the commercial rights income they are receiving, Lauda does not believe that the direction F1 appears to be heading in is right.
                                    "I'm worried,” said Lauda in an interview with Italian newspaper Gazzetto dello Sport.
                                    “It was right that the American owners needed time to understand what F1 is – but that is about to expire. And what they think about the future is worrying me.
                                    “The FIA, Chase Carey and Ross Brawn repeat that we need to level of the performance, but the DNA of F1 is the opposite
                                    “You are a fool if you think that to make grands prix more attractive you need to have a different winner every weekend. F1 is about competition.
                                    “Developing cars is one of the important foundations, as well as the bravery of the drivers. Instead, you want to penalise the best teams, and protect the drivers as if they are babies – with the introduction of the Halo for example.”

                                    <h2>Hooters unveils Chase Elliott's 2018 NASCAR Cup livery</h2>
                                </header>
    
                                <p>
                                    Now, Hooters, another one of Elliott’s primary sponsors, has provided a peak at what their livery will look like in the next Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series season.
                                    Elliott has driven the No. 24 Chevrolet in his first two seasons in the Cup series but will move to the No. 9 next season, in part to honor the racing heritage of his family and in particular his father, NASCAR Hall of Famer Bill Elliott.                                      
                                    Elliott, 21, remains in the hunt for this season’s Cup series championship. A win in Sunday’s Can-Am 500 at Phoenix Raceway would be the first of his career and give him the chance to compete for the series title next weekend at Homestead-Miami Speedway.
